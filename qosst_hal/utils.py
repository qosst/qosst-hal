# This function seems weird, and actually is.
# To quote a python advanced user : "it's so beautiful and so nasty"
# For those who want to understand what this is doing, and to use it,
# the docstirng of the function will include those information.
#
# If you want a better understanding however, it's just below :
# What is a decorator ?
# In Python, a decorator (or wrapper) are special functions that are used
# with a @ before a function or a class. Example :
# @wrapper
# def myfunc(a, b):
#   return a+b
#
# wrapper will be define like
# def wrapper(func):
#   def newfunc(a, b):
#       return a*b
#
# And if you try to run myfunc(3,4) you will end with 12 and not 7.
# The wrapper is modifying the function (in this case, it's even
# completely replacing the function).
# So a wrapper is a function that takes a function as its unique parameter
# and returning a function.
# You can also do wrappers with class, with the same concept.
#
# Here we want to have a wrapper with the following behavior :
# 1. If all the modules needed for the class are available, the class is returned (identity)
# 2. If one or several modules needed are missing, we return a class
#  that will throw an exception at initialization
#
# Why not raising the exception in the execution of the wrapper ?
# This is because wrappers are executed at the same time as imports,
# and we want to be able to import a module even if some
# functions in it will not be able to run.
#
# Now, how do we know the modules needed ? We could try that to get them dynamically
# from the module, but the simplest it to pass it as parameters.
#
# But wrapper only takes one parameter which is the class...
# So we need a decorator generator.
# It will take the modules in parameters, and will return
# the associated decorator (which is a function).
# So in the end, we have a function taking modules as arguments,
# that will return a function, taking a class as an argument and returning a class.
#
# This would be a valid usage :
# from cvqkd_hal.utils import need_modules
#
# @need_modules("scipy")
# def Class:
#   def __init__(self):
#       print(scipy.constants.c)
#
# WARNING : THIS WILL NOT WORK WITH FUNCTIONS

    Decorator generator.

    This will generate a decorator ensuring that the needed modules are
    loadable before starting the execution of class methods.

    Args:
        modules (str): needed modules (``*args``)

    Here is a usage example :
